# Ferro_Finder
Iron collector Bot for Metaverse using unity and hardware 
This repository contains the code and project files for a Ferro Finder Robot, a small mobile robot designed to detect and locate ferrous (iron-containing) metal objects.  The project utilizes an Arduino microcontroller for hardware control and Unity for visualization and potentially simulation/control interface development.

Overview

The Ferro Finder Robot uses a sensor (e.g., inductive proximity sensor, magnetometer) to detect the presence of ferrous metals.  The Arduino code processes the sensor data and controls the robot's motors to navigate towards the detected metal object. This repository provides the Arduino code (.ino file) required to operate the robot's hardware.

Hardware

Microcontroller: Arduino (Specify the model used, e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano)
Sensor: (Specify the sensor used, e.g., Inductive Proximity Sensor - LJ18A3-8-Z/BX, Magnetometer - HMC5883L)
Motors: (Specify the motors used, e.g., DC Motors with Gearbox)
Motor Driver: (Specify the motor driver used, e.g., L298N Motor Driver)
Power Supply: (Specify the power supply, e.g., 9V Battery)
Chassis: (Describe the robot's chassis, or link to a design if available)
Software

Arduino IDE: The Arduino code is written in C++ and should be compiled and uploaded using the Arduino IDE.
Unity: (Explain the role of Unity in the project. Is it for visualization? Simulation? Control interface? Be specific.) Example: "Unity is used to visualize the robot's sensor readings and potentially create a simulated environment for testing and development."
